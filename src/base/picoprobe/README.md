# Picoprobe
Picoprobe allows a Pico / RP2040 to be used as USB -> SWD and UART bridge. This means it can be used as a debugger and serial console for another Pico.

# Documentation
Picoprobe documentation can be found in the [Pico Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf). See "Appendix A: Using Picoprobe".
